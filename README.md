# Simple Clock with Date and Time

![example image](https://github.com/mariosemes/SimpleClockWithDateForScreenSaver/blob/main/example.jpg?raw=true)

Mounted my Home Assistant Dashboard Tablet and started to use Fully Kiosk app, which offers a fantastic feature to add a screensaver using a custom website.

Initially, I searched online for free, ad-free solutions with lots of customization options. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find anything that met my expectations. So, after about half an hour of work (including testing), I created a simple index.html file.

You can clone this repo and customize it to your liking—change the background color, typography, size, colors, region, language, and more. Once you’ve made your edits, you just run it using a straightforward raw link, as described in the README file.

The result looks clean and works beautifully. Best of all, no hosting or additional services are required—just a free GitHub account.

I hope this little project finds a place in someone else’s home as well!

Have a good one!
